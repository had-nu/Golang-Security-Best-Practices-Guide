# Golang-Security-Best-Practices-Guide
This repository is a study-oriented project focused on secure coding and DevSecOps practices using the Go programming language. It is my personal structured notations designed to help students into secure software development practices with hands-on examples and real-world use cases.

Topics include input validation, authentication and authorization, cryptography, HTTP security, error handling, and more â€” all structured to promote clean, maintainable, and secure code. The content is continuously updated as part of my ongoing learning journey in cybersecurity and secure software architecture with Golang.

Ideal for those who want to explore Go with a security-first mindset. So welcome!
